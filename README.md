Semester Encyclopedia
Introduction: -
The semester encyclopedia we’ve created is a comprehensive web application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. This application serves as a digital repository of information related to the academic semester.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content on the webpage, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout of the webpages. JavaScript is utilized for adding interactivity to the webpages.
On the server side, PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is used. It’s a popular scripting language especially suited for web development. It handles all the server-side processing, such as form handling, file upload, and interaction with the database.
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for managing and manipulating the database. It allows you to query the database and retrieve the data needed for your web application.
